# MSc-Thesis
In this folder, you can find my Master's thesis "SEPARATING STRATEGIC CHOICE FROM FORECAST ERROR: ANALYTICAL AND SIMULATION INSIGHTS INTO DUTCH IMBALANCE PRICING". You can have a look at the PDF version of the thesis and the code used both for the simulation and for the calibration of the parameters.
